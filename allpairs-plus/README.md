## Introduction

allpairs-plus is based the pairwise tool of "all pairs", and make the improve on its combination result

This topic introduces an effective data-driven test case generation technique named "Pairwise Testing", which is based on the observation that most faults are caused by interactions of two factors. To use minimal test cases that achieves maximal coverage, Crosswalk QA improves Pairwise algorithm with new "parameter self-combination" method in best practices, we split the parameter to sub-parameters, and extend Pairwise testing from one-dimensional to two-dimensional. By using this method, you can get remarkable test cases coverage, save approximately 70% or higher tests design efforts.
